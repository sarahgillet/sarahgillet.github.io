As each group that a robot encounter might be different and have different needs, it is necessary to perceive the current group dynamics and 
choose an action for assistance that would be targeted to this specific group and the dynamics in the specific moment. 
Therefore, I am interested in how robots could perceive group dynamics and act accordingly.
