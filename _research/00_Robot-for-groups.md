title: Assisting Human-Human Interactions

My research is driven by the desire to develop robots that can assist our social interactions. 
On a smaller scale, the goal is to improved social interactions among humans in groups, and improve social wellbeing.
On a larger scale, I imagine robots to assist processes such as cohesion, e.g. in classrooms, which eventually could lead to more generalized trust and therefore a better society.
