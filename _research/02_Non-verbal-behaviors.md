65% of human communication is non-verbal. Further, research in the HRI community has shown that humans react to non-verbal cues given by robots similar as to the same cues given by humans.
Therefore, I am exploring how non-verbal behaviors could be utilized to build robot behavior that shapes group dynamics.
