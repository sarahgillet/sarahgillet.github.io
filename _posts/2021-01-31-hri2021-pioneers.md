The future work abstract on <em>Autonomous Robot Behaviors for Shaping Group Dynamics</em> was accepted to 
<a href="http://www.hripioneers.info/hri21/index.html" target="_blank">HRI Pioneers</a> '21. In the abstract, we describe our efforts towards developing robots that shape human-human interactions.
We describe our current research which aims at developing robot behaviors that adjust their actions to perceived group dynamics. 
As a continuation of this line of work, we outline how reinforcement learning could be used to achieve truly effective robot behaviors that improve and shape interactions in groups.
