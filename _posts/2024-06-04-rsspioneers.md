My research statement titled <em>A computational lense to interaction-shaping robotics</em> was accepted to 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2024/" target="_blank">RSS Pioneers '24</a>. In this research statement, I summarize my past work using heuristics and machine learning methods for generating social behaviors to shape human-human interactions, i.e., foster inclusion among children and support second language learners in interaction with native speakers. Then, I discuss possible future avenues that further leverage machine learning methods to support people by supporting their human-human interactions.
