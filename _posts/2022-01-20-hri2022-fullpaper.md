Our paper on <i>Learning Gaze Behaviors for Balancing Participation in Group Human-Robot Interactions</i> explores how we can learn gaze behaviors in groups that aim to balance participation.
To avoid possibly harmful and expensive online exploration, we use a previously collected group human-robot interaction dataset. To learn gaze behaviors, we compare two methods: 
imitation learning (IL) in the form of behavioral cloning and offline RL (RL). 

After an extensive offline evaluation of learned behaviors, we deploy the two different learned behaviors in a user study.
Our results show that the learned behaviors did not compromise the interaction and could improve general amount of participation (IL) and amount of turn-taking (RL) when compared to the dataset.

The paper contains a detailed explanation of all techniques and methods used including handling of different seeds and training epochs.
