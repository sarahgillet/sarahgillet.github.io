To present our paper on <i>Ice-Breakers, Turn-Takers and Fun-Makers: Exploring Robots for Groups with Teenagers</i>, I attended Ro-Man 2022. It was an amazing experience to present in person and meet other researchers. 
In the paper, we explore how teenagers imagine and use social robots to support interactions in small groups. Our results show that each of our three groups needed and used the robot in different ways. 
If we aim to develop social robots that can assist a variety of groups and their needs, these robots will need to be able to perceive the current need of the group to offer effective support.
