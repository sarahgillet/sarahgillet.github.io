The Late-breaking report on <em>Exploring Non-Verbal Gaze Behavior in Groups Mediated by an Adaptive Robot</em> was accepted to 
<a href="https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2021humanrobot" target="_blank">HRI '21</a>. In this paper, we focused on gaze behaviors that participant's displayed as a reaction to the robot's mediating gaze behaviors.
For two groups chosen for the example, we found that participants were more likely to look at the other person when the robot mediated the interaction.
