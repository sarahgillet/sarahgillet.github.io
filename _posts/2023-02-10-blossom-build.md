In a joined building day, we build three [Blossom robots](http://guyhoffman.com/blossom-handcrafted-soft-social-robot/). Check [our github](https://github.com/sarahgillet/blossom-public/wiki) to find European distributors and the changes we made while crafting the robot. Big thanks to [USC Interaction Lab](https://github.com/interaction-lab) for organizing the worldwide workshop on building Blossom robots.
