I will be visiting <a href="https://marynel.net/">Marynel V&aacute;zquez</a> and the <a href="https://interactive-machines.gitlab.io/">Interactive Machines Group</a> at Yale University until the end of Spring 2022.
During my visit, we aim to explore how robots can facilitate group processes in the wild using different forms of communication.
