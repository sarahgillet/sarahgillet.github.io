I am currently a SERC Wallenberg Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/">Personal Robots Group</a> at the MIT Media Lab. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the division of <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439">Robotics, Perception and Learning</a> at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, where I also received my Ph.D. My research explores methods and algorithms that can enable autonomous social robots to support people. 
<br /><br />
In my Ph.D. thesis titled <em>Computational approaches to interaction-shaping robotics</em>, I explored how robots can shape human-human interactions while acting fully autonomously and investigated autonomy either through heuristics or learning approaches. 
<br /><br />
Previously, I have been working in the Corporate Research at <a href="https://www.kuka.com/">KUKA</a> where I focused on mobile robot navigation.
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Robotics at TU Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany.
