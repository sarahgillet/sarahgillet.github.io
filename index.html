I am currently a Ph.D. student at the division of <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439">Robotics, Perception and Learning</a> at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
<br /><br />
Supervised by <a href="https://iolandaleite.com/">Iolanda Leite</a>, I am exploring how robots can improve human-human interactions while acting fully autonomously. Thereby, I am interested in how robots could adjust their actions to perceived group dynamics to assist the group efficiently.
<br /><br />
Previously, I have been working in the Corporate Research at <a href="https://www.kuka.com/">KUKA</a> where I focused on mobile robot navigation.
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Robotics at TU Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany.
